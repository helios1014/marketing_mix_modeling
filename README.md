# marketing_mix_modeling (Work in progress)
A demo of my usage of Marketing Mix Modeling in PYMC

Please forgive the mess as I am still working on this project on my own personal time.  The [https://github.com/helios1014/marketing_mix_modeling/blob/main/mmm.ipynb]mmm.ipynb file contains a notebook where I am working on this project. The assumed business case is that I am working for a Marketing Agency and our client wishes to optimize their ad budget. The first task towards this goal is to analyze which advertizing channels  are driving their revenue gains and where they can find the most profitable places for greater investment.
